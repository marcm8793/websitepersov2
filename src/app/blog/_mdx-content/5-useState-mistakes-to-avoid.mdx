React's `useState` hook is one of the most fundamental hooks in modern React development. However, even experienced developers can fall into common pitfalls that lead to performance issues, unnecessary re-renders, and confusing code. In this article, we'll explore 5 common useState mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Mistake 1: Calling the Initializer Function

You probably know that you can pass a function to `useState` to give it a default value. This is useful, for example, for loading data from local storage when the component mounts. However, this is wrong:

```javascript
export function MyComponent() {
  // ❌ Wrong: This will call the initializer function on every render.
  const [data, setData] = useState(getInitialData());

  // It's the equivalent of calling the function in the body of the component:
  // const initialData = getInitialData();
  // const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);
}
```

This will call `getInitialData` on every single render, which can seriously slow down your app. The mistake is that we are calling the function instead of passing a reference.

**The Fix:**

```javascript
export function MyComponent() {
  // ✅ Good: Pass a function reference (no parentheses). It will only be called once on initial render.
  const [data, setData] = useState(getInitialData);

  // ✅ This is also fine:
  // const [data, setData] = useState(() => getInitialData());
}
```

Simply remove the parentheses to pass the function reference instead of calling it immediately.

## Mistake 2: Resetting Component State Incorrectly

Have you ever reset a component's state inside a `useEffect` like this?

```javascript
export function Profile({ user }: ProfileProps) {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
  const [comment, setComment] = useState("");

  // ❌ Bad: This is tedious and causes unnecessary re-renders.
  useEffect(() => {
    setTitle("");
    setComment("");
  }, [user.id]);

  // ...
}
```

This works, but it's pretty bad because:

1. The component first renders with the outdated values and then re-renders with the empty values.
2. It's difficult to manage. When we add more states, we have to remember to add them to the reset effect.

**The Fix:**

Instead, use the `key` prop. You know keys from rendering lists, but they are also useful for single components because they tell React to throw away the state of a component when the key changes:

```javascript
export function Profile({ user }: ProfileProps) {
  return (
    <UserProfile
      user={user}
      // ✅ Good: Changing the key will reset the whole component with all its state.
      key={user.id}
    />
  );
}

// ✅ Good: Make the key an implementation detail by creating a sub-component that is not exported.
function UserProfile({ user }: ProfileProps) {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
  const [comment, setComment] = useState("");

  // ...
}
```

This will reset `title` and `comment` (and any other state within Profile) whenever the user ID changes.

## Mistake 3: When (Not) to Use the State Updater Function

To the setter function of `useState`, you can pass either a value directly or an updater function that receives the previous value:

```javascript
export function CounterComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    // Pass the new value directly:
    setCount(count + 1);

    // Or use the functional argument that receives the previous value:
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }
}
```

The function variant helps avoid a slew of problems. Here's a problematic example:

```javascript
const increment = () => {
  setCount(count + 1);
};

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    // ❌ Wrong: This will only increment the count by 1 because React batches state updates in the same render.
    increment();
    increment();
    increment();
  }}
>
  +3
</Button>;
```

**The Fix:**

```javascript
const increment = () => {
  // ✅ Good: Use the functional form of the setter function to always get the latest state.
  setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
};

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    increment();
    increment();
    increment();
  }}
>
  +3
</Button>;
```

However, you don't always need the functional version. As the React docs state: **"Is using an updater always preferred?"**

_You might hear a recommendation to always write code like `setAge(a => a + 1)` if the state you're setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary._

_In most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the `age` state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a "stale" `age` at the beginning of the event handler._

Use the functional form when:

- You do multiple updates within the same event
- You're accessing the state variable itself in a way that's inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders)
- If you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax

## Mistake 4: Not Deriving State Correctly

Sometimes you need to calculate a value based on an existing state. Let's say, for example, we have a `firstName` and a `lastName` input, and we want to combine them into a full name. Beginners often create a new state for this and update it inside an effect:

```javascript
export function MyComponent() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");

  // ❌ Bad: Redundant state and unnecessary Effect.
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + " " + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);

  // ...
}
```

This is verbose, confusing, and it causes unnecessary re-renders.

**The Fix:**

Instead, you can calculate the value directly in the component body:

```javascript
export function MyComponent() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");

  // ✅ Good: Calculate the full name during rendering.
  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

  // ✅ Also for function calls:
  const initials = getInitials(firstName, lastName);

  // ✅ Or for map, filter, etc.
  const lastNameAnonymized = lastName
    .split("")
    .map((char, index) => (index < 2 ? char : "*"))
    .join("");

  // ...
}
```

You can even call functions as long as they run fast. If you have an expensive function or you're working with a huge array of data, you should wrap the call in `useMemo`. However, once the React 19 Compiler is out, even this will not be necessary anymore because React will do it automatically!

## Mistake 5: Managing Form State Incorrectly

For complex form handling, I prefer React Hook Form. However, sometimes you want (or need) to do things manually. When you have a form with multiple input fields, please don't do this:

```javascript
export default function Page() {
  // ❌ Bad: Using multiple useState hooks for each form field.
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [street, setStreet] = useState("");
  const [city, setCity] = useState("");
  const [zipCode, setZipCode] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = {
      firstName,
      lastName,
      email,
      street,
      city,
      zipCode,
    };
    alert("Form submitted: " + JSON.stringify(formData, null, 2));
  };

  const handleReset = () => {
    // ⚠️ Managing separate state variables is complex and error-prone.
    setFirstName("");
    setLastName("");
    setEmail("");
    setStreet("");
    setCity("");
    setZipCode("");
  };

  const isFormValid = [firstName, lastName, email, street, city, zipCode].every(
    (value) => value.trim() !== ""
  );

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* ... form fields ... */}</form>;
}
```

As you can see, having a separate state for each input makes the form hard to manage because you have so many separate values and setters.

**The Fix:**

Instead, put everything into a single state object:

```typescript
// This is only required if you use TypeScript (which you should)
interface FormData {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  zipCode: string;
}

// Keeping the initial state in a variable makes it easier to reset the form
const initialFormData: FormData = {
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  email: "",
  street: "",
  city: "",
  zipCode: "",
};

export default function Page() {
  // ✅ Good: Using a single useState hook with an object.
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<FormData>(initialFormData);

  const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert("Form submitted: " + JSON.stringify(formData, null, 2));
  };

  const handleReset = () => {
    setFormData(initialFormData);
  };

  const isFormValid = Object.values(formData).every(
    (value) => value.trim() !== ""
  );

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* ... form fields ... */}</form>;
}
```

Now, submitting, resetting, or validating the form state is much easier because we have a single object.

**And this is how you update a value in this form state:**

```javascript
// You can pass this function to any form field as long as the `name`s match
const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFormData((prevData) => ({
    ...prevData,
    [name]: value,
  }));
};

// Usage in JSX:
<input
  id="firstName"
  // The name must be the same as the key in the state object
  name="firstName"
  // This is how you display & update the value in the state
  value={formData.firstName}
  onChange={handleChange}
  placeholder="Enter first name"
/>;
```

## Conclusion

These five mistakes are incredibly common, even among experienced React developers. By avoiding these pitfalls, you'll write more performant, maintainable, and readable React code:

1. **Pass function references** to useState initializers, don't call them
2. **Use the key prop** to reset component state instead of useEffect
3. **Use updater functions** when you need the latest state value or do multiple updates
4. **Derive state** during rendering instead of storing redundant state
5. **Group related form state** into objects instead of separate useState calls

Remember, these patterns will help you build better React applications with fewer bugs and better performance. Happy coding!
