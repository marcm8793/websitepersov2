**_As developers, the tools we use daily can make or break our productivity. Over time, I have curated a set of tools that streamline my workflow, boost efficiency, and make coding a more enjoyable experience. In this article, I will share the tools I rely on every day and explain why each one has earned a permanent spot in my setup._**

## **Claude Code**

Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that has transformed the way I approach development tasks. Built by Anthropic, it provides intelligent code suggestions, helps debug complex issues, and can explain code in plain language. What sets it apart is its deep understanding of context and its ability to handle multi-file projects seamlessly. Whether I am refactoring legacy code, writing new features, or exploring unfamiliar codebases, Claude Code acts as a knowledgeable pair programmer that is always available.

## **Ghostty Terminal**

Ghostty is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that prioritizes speed and simplicity. Written in Zig, it delivers exceptional performance while maintaining a clean, distraction-free interface. The terminal supports native rendering on macOS and Linux, offers extensive customization options, and handles large outputs without breaking a sweat. Its low latency and smooth scrolling make it a pleasure to use for extended coding sessions.

## **Lazygit**

Lazygit is a terminal-based Git client that makes version control intuitive and fast. Instead of memorizing countless Git commands, I navigate through branches, stage changes, resolve conflicts, and manage commits using a simple keyboard-driven interface. The visual representation of branches and commits helps me understand repository history at a glance. It has dramatically reduced the time I spend on Git operations and minimized the risk of making mistakes with complex rebases or merges.

## **Eza**

Eza is a modern replacement for the classic `ls` command. It provides colorful, human-readable file listings with Git status integration, file icons, and tree views out of the box. The visual enhancements make navigating directories faster and more informative. I have aliased it to replace `ls` entirely, and now every file listing gives me instant context about file types, permissions, and Git status without running additional commands.

## **Fzf**

Fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder that has become indispensable in my workflow. It allows me to search through files, command history, processes, and virtually any list with incredible speed. Combined with keyboard shortcuts, I can instantly jump to any file in a project, recall previous commands, or filter through logs. The fuzzy matching algorithm is forgiving and fast, making it perfect for those moments when I vaguely remember a file name or command.

## **Zsh**

Zsh is my shell of choice, offering powerful features that go beyond the standard Bash experience. With plugins and frameworks like Oh My Zsh, I have customized it with autocompletions, syntax highlighting, and useful aliases. The intelligent tab completion saves keystrokes, while the extensive plugin ecosystem adds functionality for Git, Docker, Node.js, and more. Zsh strikes the perfect balance between power and usability.

## **Zoxide**

Zoxide is a smarter `cd` command that learns your habits. It tracks the directories you visit most frequently and allows you to jump to them with just a few keystrokes. Instead of typing long paths, I simply type `z project-name` and zoxide takes me to the right directory. It uses a ranking algorithm based on frequency and recency, ensuring the most relevant directories are always at the top. This small tool has eliminated countless keystrokes from my daily routine.

## **Conclusion**

The right tools can significantly impact your development experience. Each tool in my setup has been chosen for its ability to reduce friction, automate repetitive tasks, and keep me focused on what matters most: writing great code. I encourage you to experiment with these tools and find the combination that works best for your workflow. The time invested in optimizing your development environment pays dividends every single day.
